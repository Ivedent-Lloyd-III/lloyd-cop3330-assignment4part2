todo list gui
this is to help with using the prototype todo list application

this application was coded as a demo which means some of the list is already completed

to add a new item fill in text boxes with the required data in the format the user desires and click "Add New Item"

the date can be filled in as YYYY-MM-DD or any way the user desires

to mark an item as completed simply double click the cell under "status" and type in "completed" or "incomplete"... "i" or "c" also works

to edit an item simply double click the cell you wish to change and fill in that cell with the new data 

to delete a whole item simply highlight a row and click "Delete Item"

all items can be deleted and the todo list populated as desired

to sort the items by date click the cell "Due Date" and this will arrange the list by date

to mark an item as completed simply type in "completed" or "incomplete"... "i" or "c" also works

to sort items by completed status simply double click the cell "status" and the items will sort by completion status
